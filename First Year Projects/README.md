# Unity Game Portfolio

This README provides an overview of my first Unity game portfolio project created approximately 6 years ago. The portfolio consists of 4 different game scenes that showcase various mechanics and gameplay styles I implemented as a beginner game developer.

## Overview

This portfolio demonstrates my early work with Unity and C# programming, featuring:
- 2D Car Game
- 2D Horse Adventure Game
- Mastermind Puzzle Game
- Pachinko Game

## Game 1: 2D Car Game

A top-down 2D driving game where players control a car to navigate through a level.

### Features:
- Realistic car movement with acceleration, deceleration, and steering
- Lives system with respawn points
- Key card collection (Red, Blue, Yellow) to unlock matching doors
- Money/coin collection system
- Enemies that shoot projectiles
- Camera that follows the player
- Win condition when reaching a specific point

### Controls:
- Arrow keys or WASD for movement
- Vertical axis controls acceleration/deceleration
- Horizontal axis controls steering

## Game 2: Horse Adventure Game

A 2D side-scrolling adventure where players control a horse character.

### Features:
- Side-scrolling movement and jumping mechanics
- Lives system
- Treasure collection (3 treasures needed to open the exit)
- Enemy characters and hazards
- Sound effects triggered by player actions and collisions
- Camera follows the player
- Health/lives display UI
- Text prompts in game world

### Controls:
- Arrow keys/WASD for movement
- Space to jump
- Space for horse sound effect

## Game 3: Mastermind Game

An implementation of the classic code-breaking puzzle game.

### Features:
- Random color code generation
- Multiple rows for guessing attempts
- Visual feedback on correct guesses
- Win/lose conditions
- Secret cheat menu (press 'C')

### Controls:
- Number keys 1-4 to change color pegs
- Enter/Return to submit guess
- C key to toggle cheat menu

## Game 4: Pachinko Game

A physics-based ball game inspired by Pachinko.

### Features:
- Ball launching mechanics
- Physics-based ball movement
- Score system based on where balls land
- Limited number of balls (25)
- Visual effects with lights
- Win condition at score of 1500

### Controls:
- Left Alt and Right Alt to launch balls from different positions

## Technical Implementation

The project demonstrates various Unity programming concepts:
- Player control systems
- Camera following
- Collision detection and triggers
- Score and lives management
- Scene management
- Audio implementation
- Simple UI systems
- Game state management (win/lose conditions)

## Development Notes

This was my first significant Unity project, serving as a learning experience for:
- C# programming basics
- Unity's component-based architecture
- Physics and collision systems
- UI implementation
- Game state management
- Audio implementation

While the code may not follow best practices by today's standards, it represents my starting point in game development and the foundation of skills I've built upon since.

## Cheat Codes

- In Car Game: Press 'C' to get all key cards and 50,000 money
- In Horse Game: Press 'C' to increase jump height
- In Mastermind: Press 'C' to view the correct color combination
