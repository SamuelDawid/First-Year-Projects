### 3. Horse Adventure Platformer
A 2D side-scrolling platformer featuring a horse character on a treasure-hunting adventure.

**Features:**
- Character movement with jumping mechanics
- Treasure collection system (3 treasures required)
- Enemy AI with flying enemies
- Lives system with visual indicators
- Hazard detection (traps, enemies)
- Audio feedback for actions
- Character face direction system
- Ground detection and physics

**Key Scripts:**
- `moving.cs` - Player character controller
- `Control.cs` - Game management and scoring
- `TresureCollect.cs` - Collectible treasure system
- `Flyingenemy.cs` - Enemy AI behavior
- `HellScript.cs` - Hazard mechanics
- `HorseAudio.cs` - Sound effects
- `DoorsOpen.cs` - Level progression

### 4. MasterMind Puzzle Game
A digital recreation of the classic code-breaking board game.

**Features:**
- Random color sequence generation (6 colors available)
- 12 attempts to guess the correct sequence
- Real-time feedback system
- Cheat mode for debugging
- Win/lose detection
- Color selection with number keys (1-4)
- Visual feedback with UI elements

**Key Scripts:**
- `MasterMind.cs` - Core game logic and UI management

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features

### Programming Concepts Demonstrated:
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Class inheritance and encapsulation
- **Physics Systems**: Rigidbody2D, collision detection, force application
- **Audio Integration**: AudioSource and AudioClip management
- **UI Systems**: Canvas elements, Image arrays, Text components
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard and mouse input processing
- **Scene Management**: Scene transitions and game state persistence
- **Static Variables**: Cross-scene data persistence
- **Coroutines**: Time-based mechanics (implied through destroy timers)

### Unity Systems Used:
- 2D and 3D Physics
- Collision Detection (OnTriggerEnter, OnCollisionEnter)
- Transform manipulation
- Prefab instantiation
- Layer masks for ground detection
- Audio system integration
- UI Canvas system
- Scene management

## üéØ Development Tools & Cheats

Several games include developer tools and cheat codes for testing:

- **Pachinko**: Debug lighting and score manipulation
- **Car Game**: 'C' key for unlimited resources and all key cards
- **Platformer**: 'C' key for enhanced jump height
- **MasterMind**: 'C' key to reveal the solution

## üèÜ Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I gained experience in:

1. **Game Physics**: Understanding 2D physics, forces, and collision systems
2. **User Interface**: Creating functional game UIs with Unity's Canvas system
3. **Audio Integration**: Implementing sound effects and audio feedback
4. **Game State Management**: Handling lives, scores, and win/lose conditions
5. **Input Systems**: Processing player input for various control schemes
6. **Code Organization**: Structuring code with reusable components
7. **Problem Solving**: Debugging and implementing game mechanics from scratch

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run these projects:

1. Open Unity (2018.x or later recommended)
2. Import the project folder
3. Ensure all scripts are properly attached to GameObjects
4. Build and run individual scenes for each game

## üìù Notes

These projects represent my first steps into game development and showcase progression from simple mechanics to more complex game systems. Each game demonstrates different aspects of Unity development and C# programming fundamentals.
